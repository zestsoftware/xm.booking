History of xm.booking
=====================

2.1 (unreleased)
----------------

- Added missing return statement in the size_estimate indexer.
  You may want to reindex the size_estimate index.
  [maurits]


2.0 (2010-09-24)
----------------

- Made booking table compatible with both Plone 3 and 4, by using
  either poi_niceName (Plone 3, Poi 1.2) or @@pas_member (Plone4).
  [maurits]

- Explicitly load the permissions.zcml file from
  Products.eXtremeManagement, otherwise you might get a
  ComponentLookupError on zope startup.
  [maurits]

- Added z3c.autoinclude.plugin target plone.
  [maurits]

- Use plone.indexer instead of the deprecated
  registerIndexableAttribute which no longer works in Plone 4.  Added
  dependency on plone.indexer for this, so using Plone 3.3 is
  recommended (might still work on earlier versions).

1.1 (2010-05-01)
----------------

- Avoid renaming bookings that were added via the tracker at the
  moment you edit them.
